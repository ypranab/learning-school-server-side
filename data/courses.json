Ricciardo’s departure at the end of the season was confirmed by McLaren in August. The Perth-born driver was not performing up to expectations and the Surrey-based outfit decided to pull the plug early. This was not a popular decision, as many people including Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton felt that the 33-year-old should have gotten more time. For now, he is without an F1 seat but he’s too valuable a driver to remain on the sidelines. Strong rumors have linked him back to a move to Alpine. Team boss Otmar Szafnauer has not confirmed anything as of yet, but he remains the favorite. This is especially because their junior driver Oscar Piastri, who was first choice to replace Fernando Alonso at the team is reportedly on his way to McLaren. There are some other teams who are interested in securing the services of Ricciardo. Both him and Haas team principal Guenther Steiner recently admitted that they held talks about their 2023 seat a few weeks ago. A decision regarding his future in F1 is expected to be announced very soon.

    "details": "On Thursday night’s episode of Up Late, Ben Harvey has suggested Troy Mercanti start an OnlyFans account if he wishes to challenge anti-consorting laws. The notorious bikie will fight allegations that he broke WA’s stringent anti-consorting and insignia laws — but is also watching a High Court challenge to the regulations which the State Government have touted have the nation’s toughest against outlaw motorcycle gang members. The long-time one per center was not in court on Wednesday when the not guilty pleas were entered. WATCH UP LATE IN THE VIDEO PLAYER ABOVE But his lawyer Paul Holmes was, who revealed that Mercanti’s defence will be on two fronts — against elements of the alleged offence, and the legislation itself. Mercanti was charged with the two offences outside an Italian restaurant in front of shocked onlookers earlier this year. According to eyewitnesses, Mercanti — dressed in a T-shirt and shorts — was having lunch with long-time friend John Kizon at Mt Hawthorn’s Lupo Lab when more than a dozen officers from the gang crime squad descended and asked him to step outside. Soon afterwards, he was told he was being charged via summons with displaying gang insignia, which was prohibited under sweeping laws that came into effect a few months ago. Earlier the same week, Mercanti was hit with a dispersal notice by police while picking up a friend at the airport. Mercanti’s case was adjourned until October to be allocated a trial date. On Up Late, Harvey warned fighting in court may get expensive for Mercanti, and suggested a way he may be able to come up with the cash. Harvey may have gotten the idea after it was this week revealed that Dhakota Williams — the 21-year-old daughter of slain underworld king Carl Williams started an OnlyFans account. “If it’s good enough for the wife and daughter of slain gangland boss Carl Williams then it’s gotta be good enough for Troy Mercanti,” Harvey says. “See Troy’s OnlyFans page for exclusive tips for how a modern outlaw can best accessorise… find out why black and white are the only colours you need in your wardrobe… a showcase of latest leather trends… tips on keeping healthy. “And exclusively for OnlyFans subscribers... an inside look at the man who put the soft into soft serve, how he relaxes listing to 80s glam-rock and some cosplay as a Lego spaceman.”"

    "details": "Meghan Markle's Nelson Mandela story continues to unravel after the only South African cast member of 'The Lion King' said he was \"baffled\" by her suggestion that he told her his country had \"rejoiced\" when she married Prince Harry. The former Suits actress recalled an encounter she had at the 2019 London premiere of 'The Lion King' with an actor from South Africa who made a comparison to her wedding with Prince Harry and Nelson Mandela. “He looked at me, and he’s just like light. He said, ‘I just need you to know: When you married into this family, we rejoiced in the streets the same we did when Mandela was freed from prison,’” she said during an interview with The Cut. The Daily Mail revealed Dr John Kani, who claims he was the only South African actor in the film, said he did not attend the premiere and had never met the Duchess of Sussex. \"I have never met Meghan Markle,\" he told the MailOnline. \"This seems like something of a faux pas by her. I have I have never met the duchess at all. I am the only South African member of the cast and I did not attend the premiere in London. \"The only South African was me playing Rafiki. But I did not go to the opening in Leicester Square as I didn't have the time to do that. It just may be a mis-remembering on her side. \"It is baffling me.\" Nelson Mandela’s grandson said he was “surprised” when he heard Ms Markle compare her wedding with Prince Harry to his grandfather being freed from prison. He said it “cannot be equated to as the same\". The Duchess of Sussex was met with heavy criticism online after she told the story to The Cut. \"The damage her and her husband are doing to the Queen and the Royal Family is incalculable... these two hypocritical, self-obsessed liars are in the end going to be ignored,\" said Nigel Farage"

    "details": "Lando Norris asks Max Verstappen to lend him the 2022 Dutch GP trophy as he predicts the Dutchman as a sure winner. Max Verstappen returns to his home Grand Prix in Zandvoort for the 2022 Dutch GP. And it seems like the Dutchman will enjoy another easy victory this weekend. Max has a 93-point advantage in the drivers’ championship over Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc ahead of the race. And at this rate, Max can cruise comfortably, to claim his 2nd Championship title this season. But Max does not want to lose his focus and momentum ahead of his home GP. He wants to claim his 10th win of the season in front of his home crowd in style. Recently, the Dutch GP unveiled a rather unique-looking trophy. And McLaren driver Lando Norris liked the new trophy.   a journalist asks lando if he likes the dutch gp trophy and if it will be his on sunday: “no, it’s max’s. everyone knows it’s max’s already. maybe max will give it to me, he has plenty.” i love lando norris and max verstappen friendship pic.twitter.com/LQh9cnwjLv — comfort lando norris (@safeforlando) August 31, 2022 The Brit was grabbing a bicycle in the F1 paddock when he was interviewed by Dutch press personnel. Norris was asked what he thought of the Dutch Grand Prix trophy. Norris replied, “Oh I loved it.” But he admitted he would not be able to take the trophy home. He said, “No, it’s Max’s. Everyone knows it’s Max’s already. Maybe he will give it to me, he has plenty.” Seems like Norris is not alone. As it is becoming more obvious amongst the drivers that the Dutch GP trophy has Max’s name written on it. And with a win this Sunday, even the Championship might have Max’s name for a second time.

He also became the first Dutchman to win the Championship title. And he would like to pay tribute to his father, Jos Verstappen who coached him during his karting days and developed him as a racing driver. Jos has also served as a manager for Max. Jos was an F1 driver who raced in F1 from 1994 to 2003. He has 106 race starts with no wins and he raced for a variety of teams from Benetton, Arrows, Tyrell and Honda. And for the Dutch GP, Max would be wearing a helmet that resembles the one worn by his father. He will be wearing it on a track on which he has raced numerous times while Karting with his father.   ᴀ ᴛʀɪʙᴜᴛᴇ ᴛᴏ ᴊᴏs ᴠᴇʀsᴛᴀᴘᴘᴇɴ Returning to Zandvoort as a World Champion, Max chose to honor his mentor and Dad by using Jos his iconic helmet design as an inspiration 1:2 and 1:4 scale models are now available https://t.co/SxY1Y14OH2 pic.twitter.com/tz2DdtXJM4 — Max Verstappen (@VerstappenCOM) August 30, 2022 Verstappen said in a video posted by him, “It’s a bit emotional as well. But I think it’s just really special to drive something like this because it’s also how I started in go-karting.” He added, “All the old pictures I have of go-karting are with this iconic design. So that’s why we thought it was a great idea to bring this back alive around Zandvoort.” Jos has never won a race in his F1 career. But wearing this helmet, Max might win his 10th race of the season and cement his name on the Championship trophy.
